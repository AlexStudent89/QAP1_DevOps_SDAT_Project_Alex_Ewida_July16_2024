QAP #1 - DevOps and SDAT
Instructions:
This QAP covers aspects from both DevOps and Software Design, Architecture and Testing.
 
Java Junit Testing and GitHub Actions (running unit tests)

We start with a new maven based Java project as we did during our class.

We had to implement unit tests for the SuggestionEngine class provided 
(https://github.com/jamie-keyin/Keyin-JUnit-Demo/blob/master/src/main/java/com/keyin/SuggestionEngine.java).  
We had to provide at least 3 different test cases that cover different user cases.
